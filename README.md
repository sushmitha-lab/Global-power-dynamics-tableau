# Global Power Dynamics: Energy Source Diversity & Nuclear Energy Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes global power generation trends with a focus on energy source diversity, nuclear energy growth, safety impacts, and sustainability. Interactive Tableau dashboards are used to explore how countries balance capacity, efficiency, and carbon reduction goals.

## Research Questions
1. How has nuclear energy production evolved globally, and which countries show significant growth or decline?
2. What is the relationship between different energy sources and their death rates per TWh?
3. How does nuclear energy contribute to global efforts in reducing carbon emissions?
4. How does the diversity of energy sources affect overall power generation capacity and efficiency?
5. How have fuel dependency patterns changed over time across countries?

## Data Sources
- Global Power Plant Database  
- World Nuclear Energy Generation Dataset  
- Death Rates from Energy Production Dataset  

## Key Insights
- Global nuclear energy production increased steadily from the 1970s, peaking in the early 2000s, with declines following major safety events.
- Nuclear and hydropower have significantly lower death rates per TWh compared to fossil fuels.
- Countries with diversified energy portfolios tend to have higher and more resilient power generation capacity.
- Emerging economies, particularly China, show rapid growth in nuclear and renewable energy adoption.
- Long-term trends indicate a global shift from fossil fuels toward cleaner energy sources.

## Tools & Technologies
- Tableau (Data visualization and dashboarding)
- Excel / CSV (Data preprocessing)
